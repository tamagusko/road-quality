`November 11, 2022 by Tiago Tamagusko`

- Best: Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Portugal.
- Worst: Moldova, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ukraine, Romania.

### Tendencies

There is a tendency for eastern countries to have better-rated highways. A positive outlier is Croatia's 6th, with a score of 5.6, which has a considerably better road network than its neighbors. There are also two negative outliers; Belgium (4.4) and Italy (4.4) have worse scores than their neighbors, slightly below the European average of 4.45. One point to note is that the score considers extensiveness and condition, so sparsely populated countries tend to have worse ratings.

### Difficulties in the North

Countries like Iceland (4.1) and Norway (4.5) have considerably low scores. This can be explained by the sparse population and the adverse climate that hamper highway construction, maintenance, and rehabilitation.

### Western Europe with top scores

The best in Europe are the Netherlands (6.4), Switzerland (6.4), Austria (6.0), and Portugal (6.0). Switzerland and Austria stand out in the center. Likewise, the Netherlands is relatively better than its neighbors. Finally, Portugal has a slightly better road network than Spain (5.7) and France (5.4) and is much better than Italy (4.4).

### Eastern Europe with the lowest scores

The worst scores are located in Eastern Europe. Moldova (2.6), Bosnia and Herzegovina (2.8), Ukraine (3.0), and Romania (3.0).
